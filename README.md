Special thx to @JaKooLit for being an essential part of the hyprland community for noobs (and for the template of the hyprland config),@notusknot for the nix template and all the NixOS community.

> The dotfiles are agnostic to nix. Cause' they were created before my first nixos boot.
> I'm new to nix, so this flake has a lot of bad practices.
