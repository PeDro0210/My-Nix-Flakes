# Synthwave Nix Flakes

My own nix flakes with all the dependecies that I usually have in my workflow.

[workflow-vid](./assets/readme_resources/workflow.mp4)

# Before installing
 - In the hosts add your own host and add your own hardware-configuration.nix
 - Check the modules for all your names

# How to install it
  - Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PeDro0210/General-Dotfiles.git
    ```
  - Give permissions to the sh-script for running:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./install.sh
    ```
  - Run the sh-script:
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

# Important

Special thx to @JaKooLit for being an essential part of the hyprland community for noobs (and for the template of the hyprland config),@notusknot for the nix template and all the NixOS community.

> [!NOTE]
> The dotfiles are agnostic to nix. Cause' they were created before my first nixos boot.
> I'm new to nix, so this flake has a lot of bad practices.
